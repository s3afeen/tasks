    <h1><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></h1>
    <p>Mathematies is the<mark> science and study of quality, structure, space, and change.</mark> Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.</p>
    
    <p>  There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician <b>Benjamin Peirce</b> called mathematics <u>"the science that draws necessary conclusions."</u> <mark>
        Einstein</mark>, on the other hand, stated that<u>"as far as the laws of mathematies refer to reality, they are not certain: and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."</u></p>

</p>
<u>Today, mathematics is used thronghout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural science,</u> engineering, medicine, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematies concerned with application
of <b>mathematical knowledge</b> to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics
for its own sake,without having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.</p>

<h3><u>Introduction to Chemistry</u></h3>

<p><mark>Chemistry</mark> is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter combine with each other. <u><b>You study chemistry because it helps you to understand the world around you,</b></u> Everything you touch or taste or smell is a
chemical, and the interactions of these <b>chemicals</b> with each other define our universe. <mark><u> forms the fundamental basis for biology and medicine.</u></mark> From the structure of proteins and nucleic acids, to the design, synthesis and
manufacture of drugs, chemistry allows you</p>

Chemistry also acts as a major determinant in meeting the human needs for food, healthcare products, and also other <mark>materials</mark> are aimed at improving the life's quality.
